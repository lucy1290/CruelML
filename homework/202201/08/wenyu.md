# Recurrent Neural Networks

- A neural network that uses recurrent computation for hidden states is called a recurrent neural network (RNN).

- The hidden state of an RNN can capture historical information of the sequence up to the current time step.

- The number of RNN model parameters does not grow as the number of time steps increases.

- We can create character-level language models using an RNN.

- We can use perplexity to evaluate the quality of language models.
